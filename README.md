# Alexa

Here I have been using AWS alexa for calculator for custom skills and that will give the answer depending on the user query for calculalator. I have implemented 
addition and subtraction for alexa skills but user can add their own features to the source code.

The language used here is nodejs and again it can be done in python language. The source code for handler is provided here.

The steps to setup the alexa skills are:

 1- Setup the AWS developer account
 2- Make Alexa custom skills for calculator. Create the intent that will be used later. Example AddIntent, SubtractIntent. These names are casesesitive and to be 
 used for respective handler.
 3- Use the user varibales that is to be used for alexa kit and modify that accordingly
 4- Make your own sentences that are for alexa(Here I am not using the technical words.)
 5- Make the endpoints like lambda for and the files for lambda is given in this and test your alexa by virtaul device or real device accordingly.
